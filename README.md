# Rhythm Game

By Caden Phan

I learned from this project how to add key inputs into java swing which I didn't before. I learned through a youtube video.

A simple rhythm game developed in Java using the Swing library. Test your timing and reflexes by hitting the moving tile as it passes through the target area.

## Features:

Smooth tile movement with increasing speed for each successful hit

Real-time feedback with hit and miss messages

Simple controls (space bar to hit)

Randomized feedback for hits and misses to keep things fresh


## How to Play:

Press the space bar when the moving tile reaches the hitbox to score points.

Speed increases with each successful hit.

Missing a hit will reset your score and speed.

## Controls:

Spacebar - hit the spacebar whenever the square is in the hitbox

Enjoy the game!
